### Prework Questions:
1. In the process of setting up my computer, I switched my Terminal shell to zsh from bash. What are pros and cons of bash vs. zsh?
2. For the arrow functions assignment, I was supposed to create an empty repository, clone it, download a single folder from a class repository, and then add it to my empty repository. I found a way to do this, but I'd like to know the correct way, since what I did seemed like a workaround.
3. For Chocolate Pizza, I mostly used flexbox. Is this the most efficient/concise way, or is there a better method for this particular layout? Grid seemed like it might be more verbose than flexbox in this case? If I had used grid, should the whole page be on one grid, or should I use subgrids? Also, what was the best way to position the printer icon? I used transform for this, but that might not be the best practice?

### Tips:
- To switch back and forth between zsh (current default) and bash shell, run the following commands in terminal:
  `exec bash`
  `exec zsh`
  
### Favorite Discoveries:
- How to style checkboxes for chocolate pizza using `appearance: none;`, CSS sibling selector, and `:checked`, as well as include ~~strikethrough~~ checkbox labels.
