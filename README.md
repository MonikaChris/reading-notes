### Prework Questions:
1. In the process of setting up my computer, I switched my Terminal shell to zsh from bash. What are pros and cons of bash vs. zsh?
2. For the arrow functions assignment, I was supposed to create an empty repository, clone it, download a single folder from a class repository, and then add it to my empty repository. I found a way to do this, but I'd like to know the correct way, since what I did seemed like a workaround.

### Tips:
- To switch back and forth between zsh (current default) and bash shell, run the following commands in terminal:
  `exec bash`
  `exec zsh`
